# melanomaProject


project: 
Machine Learning based system for prediction of Melanoma (written in Python).
Neural network (ANN) model of skin pigmentation image processing and object identification (by asymmetries, borders, color, diameter, evolvement) and a machine learning based system that predicts the risks for Melanoma.
